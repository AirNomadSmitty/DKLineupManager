# DKLineupManager
Quick chrome extension to help manage multiple lineups on DraftKings. Allows for easy filtering of lineup cards by player as well as displaying exposure numbers. Helpful when entering many different lineups into a GPP. The UI is terrible because I wrote it for myself and don't really care about that but I might improve on it over time. Literally was written in 30 minutes on a Sunday before gametime so there's not much code structure. But hey, it works! Maybe.

##Usage
Once installed, go to the DraftKings lineup page (https://www.draftkings.com/lineup) and you should see usage numbers along with an input box above your lineup cards. You can type a players' name into the input and it will display cards of lineups with that player in them. The usage numbers will also change to show you who you're stacking with that player. 

You can also enter multiple players into the input box separated by '&' such as 'kaepernick&sproles.' Full names are not required so 'kaep & sprol' would work similarly. You'll get the idea you're a smart dude.

Note that it doesn't count lineups that are entered multiple times as inflating usage numbers. This was mainly because I don't want my cash lineup that was entered 50 times to skew usage numbers for GPP entries. Every lineup counts once regardless of entry number.
